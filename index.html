              We support the employers in meeting their recruitment and staffing requirements. Depending on the staffing
              and sub-staff needs, we provide the data of the prospective candidates to the employers for shortlisting.
              We are mostly confident of our data, which is twice pre-screened, and credentials are verified, thus
              saving the employers precious time and cost. We provide the following staff and sub-staff for the employer
              needs:
            </p>
            <p>As per your requirements, we provide you the manpower at a moderate fee for the service and ensure that
              they comply with your needs. However, if the employee leaves within six months from their date of joining,
              we shall replace without a service charge.</p>

            <p><b>How it works :</b></p>
            <p>As per your staffing requirements, we provide you a list of the prospective candidates from our databank
              in the ratio of 1:3. The prospective candidates are thoroughly pre-screened twice and credentials viz.
              educational qualifications, experience if any, address attitude and aptitude, skills, competencies, and
              proficiency in soft-skills, for final shortlisting and to issue an offer letter, as per your HR policies.
            </p>
            <p>On the day the employee joins the job, the employer will pay 50% of the salary fixed to the employee, as
              our service fee. Further, the employer will also deduct 50% from the employee’s fixed salary payable in
              the 1st month. The amounts payable by the employer as their service charge and the amount deducted from
              the employee shall be credited to the account of Just Join (JJ) Multi-Services (P) Ltd.</p>
            <p>If the employee leaves the organization within six months from the date of joining either on disciplinary
              grounds or for better prospects, a free replacement of the suitable candidate shall be facilitated,
              without any service charges to the employer. However, the employer again has to deduct 50% from the first
              month’s fixed salary of the new employee and remit it to Just Join (JJ) multi-service (P) Ltd account.
